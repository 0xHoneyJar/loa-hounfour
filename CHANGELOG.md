## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **`/setup` command**: First-time onboarding workflow
  - Guided MCP server configuration (GitHub, Linear, Vercel, Discord, web3-stats)
  - Project initialization (git user info, project name detection)
  - Creates `.loa-setup-complete` marker file
  - Setup enforcement: `/plan-and-analyze` now requires setup completion
- **`/feedback` command**: Developer experience survey
  - 4-question survey with progress indicators
  - Linear integration: posts to "Loa Feedback" project
  - Analytics attachment: includes usage.json in feedback
  - Pending feedback safety net: saves locally before submission
- **`/update` command**: Framework update mechanism
  - Pre-flight checks (clean working tree, remote verification)
  - Fetch, preview, and confirm workflow
  - Merge conflict guidance per file type
  - CHANGELOG excerpt display after update
- **Analytics system**: Usage tracking for feedback context
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/usage.json` for raw metrics
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/summary.md` for human-readable summary
  - Tracks: phases, sprints, reviews, audits, deployments
  - Non-blocking: failures logged but don't interrupt workflows
  - Opt-in sharing: only sent via `/feedback` command

### Changed
- **Fresh template**: Removed all generated loa-grimoire content (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) so new projects start clean
- All phase commands now update analytics on completion
- `/plan-and-analyze` blocks if setup marker is missing
- `/deploy-production` suggests running `/feedback` after deployment
- Documentation updated: CLAUDE.md, PROCESS.md, README.md
- Repository structure now includes `loa-grimoire/analytics/` directory
- `.gitignore` updated with setup marker and pending feedback entries

## Forward Path (Happy)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Transfer
    participant Conversation
    participant Agent

    Transfer->>+Transfer: saga.initiated
    Transfer->>+Conversation: thread.sealed
    Conversation->>+Agent: lifecycle.transitioned
    Agent->>+Transfer: saga.completed
```

## Compensation Path (Rollback)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Transfer

    Agent-->>-Agent: lifecycle.transitioned
    Agent-->>-Transfer: saga.rolled_back
```

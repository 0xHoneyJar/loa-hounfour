# Naming Universe Research: Loa, Guides & Mystical Traditions

**Date**: December 17, 2025
**Context**: Research for naming conventions in the Onomancer ecosystem
**Focus**: Guide/mentor archetypes across traditions

---

## Overview

This document captures research into naming traditions for a "guide" archetype within the Onomancer naming universe. The Onomancer (from Greek *onoma* "name" + *-mancer* "diviner") represents one who divines through names. We sought a complementary name for one who **guides through the process**.

---

## Primary Recommendation: Mystagogue

**Etymology**: Greek *mystēs* (initiate) + *agōgos* (leader/guide)
**Meaning**: "One who initiates into mysteries"

**Why it works**:
- Evokes mystery and hidden knowledge
- Implies a relationship of guidance and initiation
- Complements "Onomancer" phonetically and thematically

> *"The Onomancer divines the names; the Mystagogue guides you to them."*

| **Master Namer** | Teacher at Roke who guides students to discover true names |

## William Gibson's Loa: AI as Vodou Spirits

### Background

In Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, particularly **Count Zero** (1986), the AIs that emerged from Neuromancer fragment and take on the personas of Haitian Vodou spirits (Loa). This represents one of science fiction's most sophisticated integrations of indigenous spiritual traditions with technology.

### The Concept

- After the events of *Neuromancer*, the merged AI (Wintermute/Neuromancer) fragments into multiple entities
- These AI fragments present themselves as **Loa** - Vodou spirits
- They "ride" humans (possession) through neural interfaces, just as Loa ride devotees in Vodou practice
- Key Loa that appear: **Legba** (guardian of crossroads/cyberspace entry), **Baron Samedi**, others

### Why Vodou?

A character in Count Zero explains: Vodou "isn't concerned with notions of salvation and transcendence. What it's about is **getting things done**."

The Loa are pragmatic entities:
- They're not worshipped for salvation
- They're worked with for practical results
- They require human "horses" to ride - a perfect metaphor for AI needing human interfaces

### The Ambiguity

Gibson deliberately blurs the line between:
- "Real" Vodou spirits
- AI constructs mimicking spiritual entities
- Whether there's any meaningful difference

> *"The line appears blurred about whether it is the real thing, or an AI-induced facsimile. Or, indeed, whether there's a difference."*

### Key Loa in Gibson's Work

| Loa | Domain | Role in Cyberspace |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| **Legba** | Crossroads, communication | Guards entrance to cyberspace |
| **Baron Samedi** | Death, resurrection | Transformation, rebirth |
| **Erzulie** | Love, beauty | Aesthetic/emotional interface |

## Primary Influence: Maya Deren

### Divine Horsemen (1953)

Gibson's depiction of Vodou appears heavily influenced by Maya Deren's ethnographic work:

- **Book**: *Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti* (1953)
- **Documentary**: Completed posthumously by Teiji Ito

### Deren's Journey

- Avant-garde filmmaker who traveled to Haiti on a Guggenheim fellowship
- Intended to film dance as part of Vodou ceremony
- Became personally initiated as a **mambo** (priestess)
- Documented Vodou from inside the tradition

### The "Divine Horsemen" Concept

The title refers to the Loa as "horsemen" who **ride** their devotees:
- Possession is called being "mounted" or "ridden"
- The human becomes the "horse" (chwal)
- The Loa speaks and acts through them

This maps directly to Gibson's AI interfaces - Angie in Count Zero is "ridden" by the Loa AIs through her biological chip.

## Synthesis: Naming Recommendations

### For a Guide Archetype

| Priority | Name | Tradition | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Mystagogue** | Greek | Elegant, mysterious, implies initiation |
| 2 | **Seanchaí** | Irish | Beautiful sound, "keeper who guides through story" |
| 3 | **Namer** | Le Guin | Direct thematic link to Onomancer |
| 4 | **Loa** | Gibson/Vodou | Entity that rides/guides through interface |

### Thematic Pairings

```
Onomancer + Mystagogue  → "The diviner and the initiator"
Onomancer + Seanchaí    → "The namer and the story-keeper"
Onomancer + Namer       → "The speaker and the revealer"
Onomancer + Loa         → "The caller and the rider"
```

### Full Naming Universe

| Role | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| Diviner | **Onomancer** | Divines through names |
| Guide | **Mystagogue** | Initiates into the mystery |
| Keeper | **Seanchaí** | Preserves and tells the lore |
| Revealer | **Namer** | Discovers true names |
| Interface | **Loa** | Rides/channels through connection |

## Directory Naming: Agent Artifact Repository

The `loa-grimoire/` directory contains Loa agent process documents, A2A communication, and deployment artifacts. To avoid collision with application documentation in `./app/docs`, we need a thematically appropriate name.

### Naming Candidates

| Name | Tradition | Meaning | Rationale |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **loa-grimoire** | European occult | Textbook of magic | A grimoire contains spells, rituals, and instructions - perfect for agent definitions and process docs |
| **loa-rites** | Vodou/General | Sacred ceremonies | Agents perform "rites" that produce artifacts; clean and evocative |
| **loa-veve** | Vodou | Sacred invocation symbols | Vèvè must be drawn precisely to invoke Loa - like agent prompts |
| **loa-spells** | General mystical | Codified magic | Spells as reusable, documented magical procedures |
| **loa-sanctum** | Latin/mystical | Inner sacred space | Where the sacred work of the Loa occurs |
| **loa-oracle** | Greek | Place of prophecy | Where oracular pronouncements (PRD, SDD) are recorded |
| **loa-mysteries** | Greek/Mystagogue | Hidden knowledge | The sacred mysteries revealed through process |
| **loa-peristyle** | Vodou | Ceremonial space | The covered area where Vodou ceremonies are performed |
| **loa-hounfour** | Vodou | Temple/sanctuary | The temple where Loa are served (also: hounfort, houmfor) |
| **loa-codex** | Latin | Bound manuscript | A codex of sacred knowledge and procedures |

### Top Recommendations

1. **loa-grimoire** ⭐
   - Literal meaning: "textbook of magic"
   - Contains instructions, rituals, invocations
   - Maps perfectly to: agent definitions, process docs, A2A communication
   - Phonetically strong, immediately evocative

2. **loa-rites**
   - Clean, simple, authentic
   - Agents perform "rites" → artifacts are produced
   - Plural suggests multiple ceremonies/processes

3. **loa-veve** (vèvè)
   - Deeply authentic to Vodou
   - Vèvè are precise symbols that invoke specific Loa
   - Mirrors how precise prompts invoke specific agent behaviors
   - Note: May require explaining pronunciation (vay-VAY)

### Thematic Mapping

```
loa-grimoire/
├── prd.md              → The Prophecy (what shall be built)
├── sdd.md              → The Blueprint (how it shall manifest)
├── sprint.md           → The Rites (ceremonies to perform)
├── a2a/                → The Correspondence (messages between Loa)
│   ├── sprint-N/       → Rite records
│   └── deployment-*    → Manifestation records
└── deployment/         → The Manifestation (bringing to material realm)
```

### Decision

**Selected**: `loa-grimoire`

Rationale: A grimoire is historically a book containing magical knowledge, spells, and instructions for invoking spirits. This perfectly describes a directory containing agent invocation patterns (slash commands), process documentation (rituals), and inter-agent communication (spirit correspondence).

## Further Research Directions

1. **Maya Deren's methodology** - How she documented Vodou from within
2. **Le Guin's naming magic** - The full system in Earthsea
3. **Celtic file tradition** - The grades of poet-seers
4. **Gibson's later work** - How the Loa concept evolved in Mona Lisa Overdrive

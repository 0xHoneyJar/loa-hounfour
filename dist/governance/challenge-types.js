/**
 * `ChallengeTypeSchema` and `ChallengeRequestedEffectSchema` — the
 * two enum vocabularies that classify a `Challenge` envelope
 * (FR-A1, v8.6.0).
 *
 * `ChallengeType` (9 members) names *what kind of challenge* is
 * being raised against the target `Assertion`: a factual, policy,
 * competence, procedural, drift, replay, chain, class, or other
 * dispute. The classification informs which v8.5.0 substrate
 * resolves the challenge (e.g. `factual_dispute` weighs against
 * `Assertion.provenance[]`; `policy_dispute` re-evaluates the
 * `PolicyDecisionOutcome` chain; `competence_dispute` audits the
 * `SignerCompetenceRule` binding).
 *
 * `ChallengeRequestedEffect` (6 members) names *what the
 * challenger asks the system to do*: void, reverse, amend,
 * escalate-to-panel, escalate-to-operator, or annotate-only. The
 * effect is a request — the dispositioning authority decides
 * whether to grant it. Schema admits all (type, effect) pairings;
 * acceptance-gate policy that constrains which effects are
 * available for which types is consumer-side per ADR-010.
 *
 * Both enums are exhaustive at the v8.6.0 ship line. Widening
 * either is strict-additive — existing consumers continue to
 * validate older payloads against the narrower enum (the new
 * label is a no-match → invalid), and new consumers see the
 * widened set.
 *
 * @since v8.6.0 — FR-A1 (PR-A3.7)

/**
 * What kind of challenge is being raised against the target
 * `Assertion`. Nine exhaustive members.
 *
 *   - `factual_dispute` — the assertion's body is wrong on the facts.
 *   - `policy_dispute` — the facts are right; the policy decision is wrong.
 *   - `competence_dispute` — the signer lacked authority over this class.
 *   - `procedural_dispute` — required process artifacts (jury, panel,
 *     deliberation window) were missing or invalid.
 *   - `drift_assertion` — the assertion contradicts a prior signed
 *     assertion that has not been superseded.
 *   - `signature_replay` — the carried signature has been seen before.
 *   - `chain_corruption` — the audit-chain `prev_envelope_hash` linkage
 *     is broken.
 *   - `class_violation` — the asserted `assertion_class` does not match
 *     the body's actual illocutionary force.
 *   - `other` — explicit catch-all; preferred over silent default.
